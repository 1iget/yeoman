## Can I help you get started?

###Step 1: Install me

Open up a terminal and enter in the following:

```sh
$ curl https://raw.github.com/yeoman/yeoman/master/setup/install.sh | sh
```

This will immediately install Yeoman and any dependencies it may need such as Node, NPM and Ruby.

###Step 2: Create a new project

Next, enter in `yeoman init` followed by the name of the directory you would like to scaffold your application in.

```sh
$ yeoman init myapp
```
If a directory isn't supplied, we'll infer a name based on the directory you're in at the moment.

###Step 3: Profit

We'll then ask you some questions to help scaffold your project out. Simple! 


## Why Yeoman?

Yeoman is a robust and opinionated client-side stack, comprised of tools and frameworks that can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. We take care of providing everything needed to get started without any of the normal headaches associated with a manual setup.

With a modular architecture that can scale out of the box, we leverage the success and lessons learned from several open-source communities to ensure the stack developers use is as intelligent as possible.

As firm believers in good documentation and well thought out build processes, Yeoman includes support for linting, testing, minification and much more, so developers can focus on solutions rather than worrying about the little things.

Yeoman is fast, performant and is optimized to work best in modern browsers.
