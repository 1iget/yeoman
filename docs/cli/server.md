## server

Usage: `yeoman server`

The `server` command launches a preview server on port 3051 that allows you to access a running 
version of your application locally.

It also automatically fires up the `yeoman server` process, so changes to any of the applications
files cause the browser to refresh via LiveReload.

Any changes to CoffeeScript or Compass files result in them being recompiled, meaning that
no manual intervention is required to write and preview code in the format you feel most
comfortable with.

To quit the server, simply run `yeoman quit server` and this will kill the Python server
process.
